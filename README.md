# House-Price-Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and other housing attributes using Machine Learning techniques.  
The goal is to build an accurate regression model that can estimate house prices and assist in data-driven real estate decision-making.

The project was implemented and tested using **Google Colab**.


## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze housing data
- Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict house prices for new inputs
